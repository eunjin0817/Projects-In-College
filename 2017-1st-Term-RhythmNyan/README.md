# RhythmNyan

- Course: Multimedia Application
- Language: Java

This project was to have presentation related with multimedia.

I developed a rhythm game, such as [Piano Tiles](./https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Tiles).

But `RhythmNyan` is a 2d horizontal scroll game, not general rhythm game.

A user should avoid obstacles or get coins using space and up key on the beat.

WHAT THINGS I MISSED because of time...
- Made only beats of 2 song.
- Poor dealing with image movement. This is why my game is `slow`.
- I have not succeeded in this game. I should have made a victory screen.. :(
