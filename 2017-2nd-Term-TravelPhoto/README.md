# TravelPhoto

- Course: Web Programming
- Language: PHP, Javascript

This project was web progarmming with a free subject.

I developed web site for users to share their travel photographs.

[`Google Maps API`](./https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) was used for my site to mark where a user takes a picture. I thought that users could feel like they are still traveling after they come back by this location service.
